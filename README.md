# Log and File collector
This is a place to store files while I work on building out individual services for the IR toolkit.
All or most of the files in here I intend to reuse for other scripts and applications that I write moving forward.
This is really just a place to hold that data for reference later. So many tasks will need to be reused as new use cases arise, so I want to group individual functions that I create into files that can easily be imported into new projects.
This will be a long term iterative process, and very likely none of the finished products will be posted to this repository.
